# Listeriosis Outbreak WGS Analysis 
Between 2017 and 2018, South Africa experienced a severe Listeriosis outbreak. To understand and control it, scientists leveraged whole-genome sequencing (WGS) to identify the pathogen, track its source, and guide treatment strategies. As bioinformatics students, we analyzed WGS data from over 100 bacterial samples collected during the outbreak.
