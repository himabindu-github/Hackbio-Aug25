# Listeriosis Outbreak WGS Analysis 
Between 2017 and 2018, South Africa experienced a severe Listeriosis outbreak. To understand and control it, scientists leveraged whole-genome sequencing (WGS) to identify the pathogen, track its source, and guide treatment strategies. As bioinformatics students, we analyzed WGS data from over 100 bacterial samples collected during the outbreak. Our work aims to: 
-	Confirm the identity of the pathogen
-	Detect antimicrobial resistance (AMR) genes
-	Identify virulence factors such as toxins
-	Suggest effective antibiotics or treatment strategies

## 🔍 Objectives
1.	✅ Confirm the identity of the organism
2.	🧬 Determine antimicrobial resistance (AMR) profiles
3.	☠️ Detect potential toxins or virulence factors
4.	💊 Recommend potential treatments based on genomic evidence
