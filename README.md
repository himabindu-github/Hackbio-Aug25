# Stage-0 summary
This HackBio Internship is designed to provide hands-on experience in Next-Generation Sequencing (NGS) data analysis. In Stage 0, the focus was on building foundational skills in the Linux command line and setting up software environments essential for bioinformatics workflows.
This stage includes two structured projects that provide a solid starting point for working in Unix/Linux environments.
Project 1 introduced essential command-line tools used daily in bioinformatics and data processing.
