# Stage-0 summary
This HackBio Internship is designed to provide hands-on experience in Next-Generation Sequencing (NGS) data analysis. In Stage 0, the focus was on building foundational skills in the Linux command line and setting up software environments essential for bioinformatics workflows.
This stage includes two structured projects that provide a solid starting point for working in Unix/Linux environments.
## Project 1 introduced essential command-line tools used daily in bioinformatics and data processing.
### Navigating and Managing Files

- pwd – Print current directory

- cd – Change directory

- mkdir – Create new directories

- cp – Copy files/directories

- mv – Move or rename files/directories

- touch – Create empty files

### Viewing and Editing Text

- cat – Display file contents

- echo – Print text or variables

- awk – Pattern scanning and processing

- sed – Stream editing (search and replace)

- grep – Search text using patterns

## Project 2: Environment Setup with Conda

The second project focused on installing and configuring Conda, a powerful tool for managing packages and environments in bioinformatics.

Key tasks included:

- Installing Miniconda

- Initializing Conda (conda init)

- Creating and activating custom environments

- Installing tools like bwa, spades, and samtools from the Bioconda channel

- Setting proper channel priority

This stage of the internship emphasizes practical learning. Rather than passive tutorials, each concept is reinforced through hands-on exercises and small projects, making the learning deep, applied, and memorable.
